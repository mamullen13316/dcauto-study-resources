We have never met many of those people and, likely, will never meet, in-person or otherwise. Each of these people took time from their lives to publish something they know or built, so the rest of us, somehow, via some search engine, could have even a slightly more straightforward path to whatever it is we want to learn. To everyone who took the time to help the entire DevNet community, this guide is both nod of appreciation to you and also our way of paying it forward to the next person or people who, like us, feel like climbing to the top of the mountain, however strenuous, is worth the view. It would be disingenuous for us to make the climb using the ropes people left for us without leaving our own ropes to help the people who follow. We wish you success in your climb. Overview \u00b6 This guide provides content and references which will help you study and prepare yourself for the Cisco 300-635 DCAUTO Exam: Automating and Programming Cisco Data Center Solutions exam. All of the information in this guide is a curation of study resources that the authors used to study for and pass the Cisco DCAUTO exam. Attention All content in this guide strictly complies with the Cisco Certification and Confidentiality Agreement , also known as the Cisco Certification Non-Disclosure Agreement ( NDA ). We welcome and appreciate any Cisco NDA-compliant contributions from the community. Info This guide is neither affiliated with Cisco Systems, Inc. nor any of its affiliates, including Cisco DevNet. All materials in this guide are contributions from the community of Cisco DevNet enthusiasts and certification candidates. Any references to pay-for-use study materials are free of sponsorship, affiliations, royalties, and payments of any kind. We pay for these resources just like anyone else would, and we recommend the paid resources because we think they are highly valuable. Exam Topics \u00b6 The Cisco DCAUTO exam topics cover a variety of skills. Some of those skills are specific to Cisco products and solutions (ACI, Nexus, Intersight, etc.), while others are product-agnostic, foundational infrastructure automation and programmability skills (Git, Python, Ansible, etc.). This is the fourth DevNet exam that we've studied for, yet the first for which we struggled to find a curated set of resources from which to study. As we amassed notes, links, and our own code snippets, we organized everything into categories corresponding to the four sections in the Exam Topics list, so there is no ambiguity about finding the resources you need. Getting Started \u00b6 For us, liftoff is the hardest part of the study process. Getting our computers set up in a way that allows us to study and take notes always seems to take way more time than we think it will. To make that process easier for you, we tried to make the study resources in this guide as portable and consumable as possible. We think the best way to study for the DCAUTO exam is to have a great development environment, so we packaged one right into the GitHub repository which supports this site. The study material content doesn't change whether you choose to use our development environment, use the files in the GitHub repository to build a development environment from source, or use your own development environment. These are the tools that we recommend to get started with your DCAUTO exam study: An account registration with Cisco DevNet . Tip If possible, we recommend you register with and log on to Cisco DevNet with a Cisco.com account because the DevNet labs for Cisco Intersight require a Cisco.com account. A Windows or macOS computer with the following software installed : Docker Desktop . Git SCM from Git-SCM or from a Windows or macOS package manager. Visual Studio Code . Cisco AnyConnect or OpenConnect VPN client. A desktop hypervisor ( Parallels , VirtualBox , VMware Fusion , or VMware Workstation Player ). Tip A desktop hypervisor is optional. We found value/ease in using a desktop hypervisor to run local instances of the Cisco UCS Platform Emulator although DevNet provides labs with sufficient access to UCS platforms. Your favorite terminal/shell program (iTerm, PowerShell, Bash, etc.). Tip In our examples, we use a combination of the Visual Studio Code Integrated Terminal , PowerShell and the macOS Terminal application .

The DevNet Associate exam topics have many similarities with Section 1.0 of the DCAUTO exam topics. If you get comfortable with these foundational topics, you will have a much easier time studying the product-specific topics. Pay Attention to Taxonomy \u00b6 Pay close attention to the taxonomy of each exam topic, to focus your study energy in the right place. For example, if an exam topic has the taxonomy \"Describe...\" versus \"Construct...,\" you should probably spend more time reading about the \"Describe\" topic and more hands-on time with the \"Construct\" topic. This technique helps maximize the time you spend studying. Study With Someone Else \u00b6 Another point-of-view can go a long way to drive a deeper understanding of each exam topic. When you study with someone else or with a group, each person will problem-solve differently. All of these approaches allow you to share great resources or even nuggets of information that can help you make sense of something you aren't sure about, didn't understand as well as you thought you did, or even help you realize you overlooked something in your study plan. Studying with someone else has another great benefit...it keeps you accountable. We found we were far more likely to commit time to learn something or set up a lab resource when we knew someone else counted on us. There's also a healthy element of peer pressure that will help you avoid the trap of distractions, which could derail your study plan. Pre-Identify All of your Hands-On Study Resources \u00b6 Tracking down resources can consume an excessive amount of your study time without providing much of a benefit. While tempting, try to avoid diving right into topic study until you know which resources you plan to use for, at a minimum, a complete section and, at best, all of the exam topics. Change Study Topics/Sections Frequently \u00b6 Sections 2.0 (ACI), 3.0 (NX-OS), and 4.0 (UCS) each have very specific product focuses. A technique that helps us a lot is to focus 80% of our study time on one of these sections at a time and to also dedicate the other 20% to the other two topics. Why? Because it can be all-consuming to study for each of these sections! For example, it's frustrating and a waste of time to spend two or three weeks on Section 2.0, move to Section 3.0 and do the same thing, only to struggle to remember much of the Section 2.0 content by the end of your Section 3.0 study. Instead, using the same example, study all of the Section 2.0 topics, move to Section 3.0, and set time aside while you study Section 3.0 topics, just to review your Section 2.0 notes or refresh your hands-on skills. You will retain information better this way and this practice will help you to better distinguish between the product-specific Python or SDK syntax, which has some similarities between products. That can be particularly helpful when you take an exam. Reverse Plan a Study Schedule \u00b6 When you schedule an exam, start planning a study schedule backward from that date, and give yourself plenty of extra time in case you need it. This strategy can help accomplish two things: Keep you from procrastinating...and then stressfully cramming. Help you resist the temptation to reschedule your exam to a later date. This is definitely a \"slow down to speed up\" approach to study planning and the up-front time investment will save you a lot of stress and help you stay disciplined about your test preparation focus. Avoid Taking Shortcuts \u00b6 We strictly avoided any exam prep materials that compromise the integrity of the exam. We all know the ethics around those sorts of things, so there's no need to go into those details. From a purely practical point of view, you simply don't need that stuff. After having passed the DCAUTO exam, we are confident in saying that if you stick to the exam topics, you will learn the things that you need to know. Treat Failure as Shameless Learning \u00b6 Between us, we've failed A LOT of Cisco exams. We used to think a failed exam was a badge of shame, although, over many years, we learned that failing an exam is just a checkpoint on your certification journey. Sometimes life's changing circumstances don't allow you to study as much as you would like. We all learn different things at different paces, so don't kick yourself if someone you study with passes an exam before you or passes when you fail. Neither of us have deep backgrounds in ACI, NX-OS, or UCS, so we approached our first attempt at the DCAUTO exam, intending to learn where our knowledge gaps are so that we could regroup for another try. In our specific case, after completing the exam, we both just happened to feel like we over-prepared a bit (which is not a complaint), and we were fortunate to pass on our first attempt. Going into the exam without extreme self-pressure to \"do or die\" allowed us to focus our study energy on learning instead of on simply passing the exam. We passed the exam as a result of our learning which feels pretty good...much better than it would feel to pass the exam and feel like we didn't learn anything.","title":"Supplimentary Content"},{"location":"sections/appendix_a/#appendix-a","text":"","title":"Appendix A"},{"location":"sections/appendix_a/#lessons-learned","text":"","title":"Lessons Learned"},{"location":"sections/appendix_a/#know-devasc-exam-topics-well","text":"Success with the product-specific exam topics rely on the skills you develop during study for the Cisco DevNet Associate Exam .

During our exam preparation, we didn't spend a ton of dedicated time on the topics in this section because: These particular topics are pretty familiar to us from previous DevNet exam study work (DEVASC, ENAUTO, & DEVCOR) We help teach these topics in our free, ongoing, open-to-the-public DevNet Study Group meetings.

We absolutely did NOT arbitrarily insert every link from the NX-OS Programmability Guide into this page, just to fill space. There were only a few DevNet Learning Labs available which address the NX-OS exam topics, so we had to rely heavily on tediously walking through commands and configuration examples in official Cisco documentation. We highly recommend that you invest a lot of hands-on time with the examples in Cisco NX-OS documentation. Effective NX-OS hands-on lab resources were hard for us to find. The lone DevNet NX-OS Sandbox was helpful, although it had some limitations that kept us from practicing certain things, like deploying Docker Containers on NX-OS and configuring POAP. The WWT Ansible Automation Lab was a good resource for studying and testing Ansible and Docker with NX-OS. DevNet provides a Vagrant configuration that we did not use, although it is another NX-OS hands-on resource option. We did not find documentation that explicitly showed us how to construct Python scripts that consume model-driven telemetry. Instead, we pieced together many different resources (referenced in the Documentation section) and conducted a lot of trial-and-error testing in order to meet our interpretation of the exam topic intent successfully. For some really good practice, we recommend that you work through the gNMI Jupyter Walk-Through and sample Python code we put together and then write your own code to consume telemetry from different XPaths. Something we found very beneficial to our comfort level with NETCONF and YANG models was to go through the DevNet Learning Labs on those topics and, instead of copying and pasting commands (into an NX-OS hands-on environment) or even typing out the NETCONF XML payload examples in the lab guides, we forced ourselves to look at the XPath examples and then try to manually type out/construct the XML payloads. This practice helped us become much more comfortable with YANG models, XML, and NETCONF, in general. The NETCONF Jupyter Notebook we put together was an excellent resource for us to get that practice because the interactivity of Jupyter makes it fast and easy to try something, see it not work, make a change, and try again.
