# Controller Based Data Center Networking

## Overview

This section of the exam topics focuses almost entirely on working with Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) programmatically.  It is essential to be familiar with its building blocks, specifically the ACI Policy Object Model, in order to effectively construct and parse its API payloads.

???+ note "Section 1.0 Topic Details"
    - 2.1 Describe the following:
        - 2.1.a ACI target policy
        - 2.1.b ACI application hosting capabilities
        - 2.1.c Implementation of an ACI application from the Cisco ACI Apps Center
    - 2.2 Leverage the API inspector to explore the REST API calls made by the ACI GUI
    - 2.3 Construct a Python script to create an application policy using the ACI REST API
    - 2.4 Construct a Python script to create an application policy using the ACI Cobra SDK
    - 2.5 Construct an Ansible playbook to create an application policy
    - 2.6 Describe the benefits of integrating Kubernetes infrastructure using the ACI CNI plugin

## :fontawesome-solid-lightbulb: Insights

- Force yourself to use the skills you learn in this section frequently as you study the remaining exam topic sections.  Lots of repetition will help you build and retain these skills and we think it is important that these skills be second-nature to you, as you prepare for a certification exam.

- The Cisco DevNet learning labs and WWT guided walkthroughs are excellent, repeatable learning tools which present you content in small chunks.  You can repeat any or all of this content as many times as you like.

- Our favorite resource to learn this material is Pluralsight.  The author of the courses we recommend, Nick Russo, does an absolutely fantastic job of explaining core concepts in a way that we could easily consume.  Yes, Pluralsight is a paid resource and we have our own subscriptions.  In our opinion, the monthly cost is well worth the price.
